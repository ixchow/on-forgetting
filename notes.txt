On Forgetting
 by ix / tchow

Like all creatures of limited viewpoint, we live in a world of accumulated memories.

(walk to goal)

It is our recollections of the continuing /then/ that guide our actions in the infinitesimal /now/.

(clone tree)

And every action we take extends the /then/ of our memories.

(clone choice of trees?)

But memory is a finite resource. The price of new memories is the destruction of old.

We destroy as much of our world as we create.

#The destruction of forgetting is a subtle one.
#It can be neglected and forgotten.
#The more memories we create, the more we forget.

It can be a subtle destruction; memories tattered, worn, and reconfigured.
#Our memories do not disappear wholesale; rather, they become smaller, tattered, worn, and reconfigured.

But the fog of the /then/ is inevitably blown by the winds of the /now/.

#It is unlikely that in ten, twenty, or thirty years any of us will have more memories than we do now.
#Even if we remember more events, the events themselves will be smaller.

From the instant of first awareness, we build mental pathways.
#We are born without memories, but d brains, and begin immediately to organize it.

Forever catching and recording and collating and organizing and forgetting;
building the world inside our brains.

Until death returns our neurons to entropy.
And our brain forgets the world we built for ourselves to live in.

-------------

But however we choose to configure our neurons during life,
death and decay will return them to entropy,
and nothing will remain of the world
in which we lived.


#And as the /now/ becomes the /then/, new memories are created.

Until, in the end, decay consumes the last threads,
and whatever physical remenant remains,
forgets everything entire.

Through our life, we weave and patch an ever-fraying tapestry of memory.
//And in the end, we will forget the whole everything entire.

Instead, the memories we have now will be smaller, worn, and reconfigured.



#1. All experience, save for the infinitesimal now, is memory.
#Most of the world exists in our memory.
//our world is not reality; but, rather, memory.

#Everything in our world, except the very local, is memory.
#We live in a world of our immediate surroundings.
#Most of what we interact with is not reality, but memory.


We build our futures on our memories. #Memory guides our actions, builds our futures.

#3. We understand the world through memory.

3. But memory is a finite resource. Every new understanding requires forgetting.

4. The more we focus on the now, the less we know about the then.

2. But memory is a limited resource.

3. Everything
